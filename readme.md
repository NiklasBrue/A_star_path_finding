## A* Path finding algorithm

In this project I recreate the A* path finding algorithm using the python modul pygame.

# How to use it?

There are three possibilities:
1. drawing your own maze
2. generating a pseudo random maze
3. taking the maze from an image

1. Run the main file:
`python main.py`
Press `d` (for draw)\\
Place start then end then borders using the left mouse button. To delete selections use the right mouse button.

2. Run the main file:
`python main.py`

To start the algorithm use the space bar.

To reset press the 'r' key.
