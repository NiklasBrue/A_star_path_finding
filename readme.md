## A* Path finding algorithm

In this project I recreate the A* path finding algorithm using the python modul pygame.

# How to use it?

There are three possibilities:
1. drawing your own maze
`python main.py`
Press `d` (for draw). Place start then end then borders using the `left mouse button`. To delete selections use the `right mouse button`.

2. generating a pseudo random maze
`python main.py`. Press `r` (for random).

3. taking the maze from an image
`python main_img.py`. Place start then end then borders using the `left mouse button`. To delete selections use the `right mouse button`.


To start the algorithm use the `space` key. To reset press the `r` key.
