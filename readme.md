## A* Path finding algorithm

In this project I recreate the A* path finding algorithm using the python modul pygame.

# How to use it?

Run the main file:
`python main.py`

Place start then end then borders using the left mouse button. To delete selections use the right mouse button.

To start the algorithm use the space bar.

To reset press the 'r' key.
